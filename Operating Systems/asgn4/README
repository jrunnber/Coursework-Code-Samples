README		
	This file, describing the contents of our submission, 
as well as how to run the code.

fuse.c, fuse.h
	Fuse files.

aofs.c
	This is the main file of our f ilesystem. It contains 
the code for the filesystem functions to be overwritten.
	*You will need to change the macro "aofs_path" to reflect
your working path
	Compile with "make"

benchmark.c
	This is the benchmark program code.
	Compile with "make benchamrk"
	Run with "./benchmark"

init_FS_FILE.c
	This is the code for the program which initializes
the space that our filesystem occupies.
	*You will need to change the macro "aofs_path" to reflect
your working path
	Compile with "make init"
	Run with "./init"

mnt
	This is a directory to be created by you, in this directory. 
This directory will be used for benchamrking purposes and it 
will be the directory you mount the filesystem to.

FS_FILE
	This is the file created by init_FS_FILE.c. This file 
contains the contents of our filesystem.

Running Our File System:
	0) You may need root access "su root"
	1) Update the macro "aofs_path" in both aofs.c and init_FS_FILE.c
	2) Make the directory mnt: "mkdir mnt"
	3) Compile init_FS_FILE and run it
	4) make aofs.c with "make"
	5) mount the filesystem on mnt: "./aofs mnt"
	6) grab another terminal and you will be able to use our 
filesystem in the mounted directory.
	7) "umount" mnt will unmount the directory.

Running the Benchmark:
	See the insctuction in our Design Doc/Benchamrk Report
